### What I learned

This project was surprisingly easy for me. I wasn't sure where I was in terms of my front end experience but the total time I spent on this was less than 5 hours. Most of which was firing up my lap top and local workspace. 
  
  I was not use having most assets and resources supplied for me, which is why I think the process was so much quicker than usual. This dramatically sped the process up for me, because most of my time is usually spent searching for this assets etc.
I did however forego using the partition images, and I opted out on creating my own using css/ flexbox. All in all this was a fun project.   

Some of the code I am proud of:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.partitionContainer {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: space-around;
}


.dotsContainer {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-around;
    width: 42px;
}

.middleDots {
    width: 7px;
    height: 19px;
    border-radius: 6px;
    background-color: #dadada;
}

.leftLine {
    border-bottom: 1px solid hsl(217, 19%, 38%);;
    width: 51%;
    margin-left: 10px;
    margin-right: 10px;
}
.rightLine {
    border-bottom: 1px solid hsl(217, 19%, 38%);
    width: 51%;
    margin-right: 10px;
    margin-left: 10px;
}
```
```js
window.onload = function (){
  /* call async function and api request here and
  render data dynamically 
*/
}
```
